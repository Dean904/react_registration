# CRUD App with SpringBoot & React 

The Springboot application hosts an embedded H2 server and a single JPA Entity named HealthcareProvider. A restful API exposes basic CRUD (create/read/update/delete) operations for the HealthcareProvider.

The React application controls the UI, utilizing the API to manipulate HealthcareProviders.
